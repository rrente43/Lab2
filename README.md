# Lab2
Interpreting and implementing the following instructions:

RISC-V Instruction
LW,RD,RS1,IMM
SW,RD,RS1,IMM
ADD,RD,RS1,RS2 ADDI,RD,RS1,IMM

You may assume the following:
1) User input will be in all upper-case
2) Delimiter will be your choice
3) You may assume base 10 or base 16 for immediate addressing (whichever is easiest for
you, but be clear in your instructions to the user)
4) User input will be valid instructions and not trying to test your robustness
5) Registers will use their x# notation when given by the user (e.g., “x5” or “x31”)

Example String
“LW X7 1000(X5)”
“SW X5 2000(X0)”
“ADD X6 X0 X29” “ADDI X6 X6 329”
